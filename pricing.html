	<h2>About the ticket pricing</h2>
	
	<p>It is hard to make guesses or hard promises around the pricing for camp. The prices below are estimates, based on a preliminary budget. By the time we are actually selling tickets, the final pricing will be knwon.</p>
	
	<p>A ticket includes</p>
	
	<ul>
		<li>Your participation at camp, you are welcome from Thursday evening 18:00 until Sunday evening at 18:00</li>
		<li>All the perks all other participants have, you can enjoy the camp to its fullest!</li>
		<li>A spot to pitch a tent for yourself and your family.</li>
		<li>A warm meal on Friday evening (BBQ) and another warm meal on Saturday evening (spaghetti, stoovlees, we haven't decided yet). Vegetarian options will be available.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>The pricing is currently estimated at:</p>

	<p>It is important that ticket prices may still flux before tickets go on sale. We do not, however, expect prices to go up.</p>
