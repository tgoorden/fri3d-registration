	<h2>About ticket pricing</h2>
	
	<p>For now, it is still tough to make hard promises on the pricing for camp. The prices below are estimates, based on a <a href="https://ethercalc.org/fri3d_hackathon_1">preliminary budget</a>. By the time we are actually selling tickets, the final pricing will be knwon. Preregistrations, sponsoring and potential unknown costs may be factors that influence ticket prices.</p>
	

	<p>In order to promote families in participating for camp, the pricing is currently estimated at:</p>
	
	<table class="table table-striped table-bordered table-condensed">
		<tr><th>Ticket type</th><th>Ticket description</th><th colspan="2">Ticket price</th></tr>
		<tr><td>Youngling</td><td>Less than 3 years old on 15 August 2014</td><td>2<sup>3</sup> €</td><td>8 €</td></tr>
		<tr><td>Initiate</td><td>Less than 6 years old on 15 August 2014</td><td>2<sup>4</sup> €</td><td>16 €</td></tr>
		<tr><td>Trainee</td><td>Less than 12 years old on 15 August 2014</td><td>2<sup>5</sup> €</td><td>32 €</td></tr>
		<tr><td>Apprentice</td><td>Less than 24 years old on 15 August 2014</td><td>2<sup>6</sup> €</td><td>64 €</td></tr>
		<tr><td>Knight</td><td>24 years old or older on 15 August 2014</td><td>2<sup>7</sup> €</td><td>128 €</td></tr>
		<tr><td>Master</td><td>8 bit business ticket with invoice</td><td>2<sup>8</sup> €</td><td>256 €</td></tr>
	</table>
	
	<p>It is important that ticket prices may still flux before tickets go on sale. We do not, however, expect prices to go up.</p>
