	<h2>About ticket pricing</h2>
	
	<p>For now, it is still tough to make hard promises on the pricing for camp. The prices below are estimates, based on a <a href="https://ethercalc.org/fri3d_hackathon_1">preliminary budget</a>. By the time we are actually selling tickets, the final pricing will be knwon. Preregistrations, sponsoring and potential unknown costs may be factors that influence ticket prices.</p>
	
	<p>A ticket includes</p>
	
	<ul>
		<li>Your participation at camp, you are welcome from Thursday evening 18:00 until Sunday evening at 18:00</li>
		<li>All the perks all other participants have, you can enjoy the camp to its fullest!</li>
		<li>A spot to pitch a tent for yourself and your family.</li>
		<li>A warm meal on Friday evening (BBQ) and another warm meal on Saturday evening (spaghetti, stoovlees, we haven't decided yet). Vegetarian options will be available. You will have to bring food to provide for your own breakfast, lunch and snacks.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>In order to promote families in participating for camp, the pricing is currently estimated at:</p>
